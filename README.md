# Adventure
 Raycaster in Raylib; written in C++. I implemented DDA to give clearer edges to the walls, 
 and made as much performance intensive parts const so as not to mutate much uncecessary state.

 TODO:
 * Add textures to walls and expand the map.
 * Create ceiling and floor textures as well.
 * Add doors and way to interact witht the world space.
